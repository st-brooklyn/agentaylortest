# Recast.AI - SDK PHP
Recast.AI official SDK in PHP

## Synospis

This module is a wrapper around the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) API, and allows you to:
* [Analyse your text](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-PHP/wiki/01---Analyse-text)
* [Manage your conversation](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-PHP/wiki/02---Manage-conversation)
* [Receive and send messages](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-PHP/wiki/03--Receive-and-send-messages)


## Installation

Install the package using npm, as shown below:
```bash
composer require recastai/sdk-php
```

You can now use the sdk in your code.

Using the entire SDK:
```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use RecastAI\Client;

$client = new Client('YOUR_TOKEN');
```

Extracting one single API:
```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use RecastAI\Client;

$request = Client::Request('YOUR_TOKEN');
$connect = Client::Connect('YOUR_TOKEN');
```
